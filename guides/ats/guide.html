                Overview
            </h2>
            <p>
                This guide enhances the game's visuals and introduces additional quality-of-life improvements during gameplay.
                Essentially, it's a curated list of mods that enhance graphics, physics, and overall game experience in addition 
                to optional map mods. Please note that maps typically require paid DLC and are included only if you wish to add 
                extra content. Otherwise, you don't need anything else but the base game to enjoy. 
            </p>
            <!-- Requirements -->
            <h2 id="requirements">
                Requirements
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You will need around 30GB for mods and game content.</li>
                <li>Windows 10 or higher (64-bit), Linux and Mac possibly work just as well (but some processes will be
                    different).</li>
                <li>A text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> is stongly
                    recommended.</li>
                <li>A computer capable of being able to play the game itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- Recommended Specs -->
            <h2 id="recommendedSpecs">
                Recommended Specs
            </h2>
            <p>
                The game is surprisingly intensive at times, so it is recommended to have the following specs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>CPU:</b> Any quad-core processor (2.5GHz or more).</li>
                <li><b>RAM:</b> 8GB or more.</li>
                <li><b>GPU:</b> A basic GTX 1080 will run it just fine but may experience stutter or lag with demanding
                    mods/settings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Optionally, a modern controller or a wheel. I am attempting to make or find a good controller config
                which works well with the game and provides advanced features. 
            </p>
            <!-- Getting Started -->
            <h2 id="gettingStarted">
                Getting Started
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once you're ready to begin, follow these steps to set up the game:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the game from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</li>
                <li>Install the game and run it once to make sure it works.</li>
                <li>Begin in-game setup of your profile.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then note your documents folder, inside is a folder where you will be able to install mods into simply
                titled "mod" which allows for drag and drop installation of mods. This is required for mods which need a manual
                installation.
            </p>
            <!-- Steam Workshop -->
            <h2 id="workshop">
                Steam Workshop
            </h2>
            <p>This section may be expanded in the future to suit a realistic economy playstyle.</p>
            <p>
                The game employs Steam workshop where you can download mods directly from others into your game. This is
                the easiest way to install mods as it is a one-click install. However, some mods are not on the workshop
                and require a manual installation. If you want to use the workshop, you will need to subscribe to the mod 
                and it will automatically download into your game. You can then enable it in the mod manager in-game.             
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable mods in-game, go to the main menu and click on the mod manager. From there, you can enable or
                disable mods as you see fit by double clicking or clicking on the red button. If the mod is active, the
                button becomes green. From there, you can adjust the load order/priority of the mods by simply clicking,
                going to the bottom of the list and choosing the up or down arrow. The game is loading these mods From
                top to bottom, so the top mod will load first and the bottom mod will load last. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                From here, the game is modded and you can stop, but if you're wanting to improve performance and graphics
                or, install different map mods for access to Canada or Mexico, continue to follow the guide.
            </p>

            <h3>Side Note: Trustworthy Mod Sites</h3>
            <p>
                If you're looking for mods outside of the Steam Workshop, you can use the following sites:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://forum.scssoft.com/" target="_blank">SCS Forums</a> is a site that has a variety of mods
                        for the game. It's the official forum for the game developers and you can usually find mods which
                        are up to date and safe to use.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://truckymods.io/" target="_blank">Truckymods</a> is a third party but professional and
                        official way to aquire mods for some authors. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Some mod authors use file sharing sites like sharemods. These are usually safe but can have ads that
                download malware. Be careful when downloading from these sites.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <!-- DXVK -->
            <h2 id="dxvk">
                DXVK
            </h2>
            <p>
                DXVK is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 9/10/11 which allows running 3D applications on Linux
                using Wine. On Windows, it usually improves performance, especially true for titles utilizing DirectX 9. 
                ATS already seems to use DXVK when you're using Linux. However, you can use it on Windows by following these steps:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><b>This may seem great but:</b><br>
                Your GPU must support Vulkan in order for this to work and actual performance gains will vary.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/latest/"

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Using 7-Zip, open the main archive, then the second one. Go into x64. Extract the d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll file into the game's directory
                        via the Steam install folder (Program Files > Steam > steamapps > common) then go into the game folder then bin > win_x64. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Start the game through Steam which will prompt you to verify you're running it with DirectX 11 when booting up.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check back in the folder to see a new log file.</p>

                If you don't think your computer can handle graphics mods, you can skip this section. However, if you
                think you can handle it, here are some mods to improve the graphics of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before installing any graphics mods, you're going to want to change your settings for the game
                using Notepad++ which is optional but greatly improves looks.

            <p>g_reflection may be hard to run at 3 so you can also lower it to 2.</p>
            <h3>Graphics Mods</h3>
            <p> 
                By default, there is a graphics mod that comes with the Steam Workshop bundle.
                However, there are some mods that can improve graphics even further. These are
                optional as they cost money. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you plan to pay for one of these mods, remove Realistic Brutal Graphics And Weather from your list.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Better Graphics: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DamianSVW/">Project Next Gen</a> is a $30 mod
                        that improves the graphics of the game. It is a complete overhaul of the game's graphics.
                        You need to have a Facebook account and message the creator.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Best Graphics: JBX Graphics (not recommended) is a $90 mod which goes over

                        like adding 4k-8k skyboxes. However, due to the price and the requirements 
                        to run it, you probably shouldn't get it because as much as it does look nice, 
                        Project Next Gen is much cheaper and does a similar job.

                Maps are a great way to add more content to the game. However, they require paid DLC to work. 
                If you want to add more content to the game, you can install these mods.

                        Canada: <a href="https://promods.net/setup.php?game=ats" target="_blank">ProMods Canada</a> is a mod that adds a small portion of Canada to the game. 
                        It requires Oregon and Washington. It's the only widely supported and used Canada map.

                        Mexico: <a href="https://reformaats.com/" target="_blank">Reforma</a> is a group which makes map mods for ATS. Specifically, they allow for exploration
                        into Mexico. This does require a few paid DLCs, namely: Montana, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Wyoming and Texas.
                        Since this is a lot of requirements, you can find the DLC on sale to lighten the load on your wallet. Once you're ready to download you'll require Reforma
                        Mega Resources and the main Reforma file which can be found under the downloads page. These are downloaded from TruckyMods. If you're using Promods,
                        you'll need the "Promods & Reforma Background fix" and if you support through Patreon, they offer a few extra map mods on top of the main file.

                        entire map to include all 50 states. It requires all map DLCs and is a large download. However, compatiblity can be broken for some mods and may require 
                        a patch to get working. Once you can get it set up, it provides hours of content and road trips to a variety of places.
